👋 ***Hi, I’m Thiago Luiz Rodrigues***, a Senior Solution Architect with 10+ years’ experience in cloud, development, and management. I help many companies modernize legacy applications and make them cloud native. I currently work at Itaú Bank as Senior Cloud Solutions Architect. I have AWS Solution Architect Associate certification and I’m studying for a master’s degree researching distributed systems. At 24 years old I founded Etico Software which has now been in business for 10 years.

I act as a Solution Architect, where I dedicate myself to creating designs for new solutions and modernizing legacy solutions. With a focus on high availability, security and cost, I aim to design solutions that respect the domain models. In addition, I am always looking for event-driven (EDA) solutions and technologies for business problems. I act as a mentor for teams through lectures and also as a hands-on, helping engineering to get unstuck. I also participate in creating POCs, technical refinement and in technical and business meetings.
